This
is
a long
file made
for testing the display
of view file
so that
I can see
if the FileViewer.fxml
can easily
display the
correct style
with the scrollbar
on the
right side
or would
this just
simply
get cut off the screen
and there won't be
any extra text
or that the
screen would
get really stretched
by the
text file
